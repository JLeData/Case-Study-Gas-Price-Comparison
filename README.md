# Overview

## Curosity and Interest

My friend had recently visited out of state and rented his own car to meet our friend group where we live. He mentioned that he already misses pumping $2.70 for gas in Texas which had me baffled as the gas prices in my area are around $5.00 to $6.00 average. This interaction had me curious about gas prices in recent years and how it compared to other parts of the United States. Living in California my entire life, I have seen the rise in gas prices since 2012 when I had started driving myself and pumping gas. I decided to ask this question for myself and for the capstone project as I am learning more about data analytics and working on acquiring my certificate in it. 

## Scope

Analyze gas price trends and disparity between the regions in the United States over the years. These regions consist of the  Coast, Midwest, and East Coast. Further analysis between West Coast and California.

## Objective

Utilize historical gas price data to create visualizations and compare the U.S. average price to each of the regions in the U.S. using the periods between 2000 and 2023. Main focus on Regular grade gas and include information on California for further comparisons.
