#Overview

##Curosity and Interest

Recently, a friend visiting from out of state mentioned filling up their gas tank in Texas for $2.70, leaving me astonished considering the $5.00 to $6.00 average prices in my area. This interaction sparked my curiosity about gas prices over the years, especially when compared to other parts of the United States. Having lived in California my entire life, Iâ€™ve witnessed the rise in gas prices since I started driving in 2012. This curiosity led me to explore gas prices for a capstone project as I delve into data analytics and pursue my certificate in the field.

##Scope

The project aims to analyze gas price trends and disparities across regions in the United States, including the Coast, Midwest, and East Coast. Additionally, the focus will be on comparing gas prices in California to the broader West Coast.

##Objective

Utilize historical gas price data to create visualizations and compare the U.S. average price to each region from 2000 to 2023. The primary focus will be on Regular-grade gas, and specific attention will be given to California for in-depth comparisons.
